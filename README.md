## 🎯 Objectives

- Process raw COVID-19 case data to generate meaningful summaries
- Create structured Excel sheets for direct Tableau use
- Visualize pandemic trends over time and across regions
- Enable filtering and drilling into key metrics (e.g., active cases, deaths per million, etc.)

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Country-wise Case Comparisons**
- **Interactive Global Maps**
- **Daily Trends & Growth Rate Charts**
- **Per Capita & Percentage Metrics**
- **Dynamic Filtering** (e.g., by continent, country, metric type)
